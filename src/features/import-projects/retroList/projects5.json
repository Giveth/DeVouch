Since then, OP Erigon has been serving strategic use cases that require Erigon's high efficiency on disk & performance. Notable users are Blockaid, Chainstack, Blockjoy, etc. \n\nIn the Superchain’s vision, disk space is a huge problem. For example, the sum of OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora’s OP Geth archive node size is 16.16TB. On the other hand, OP Erigon only costs 3.55 TB, which is a 78% savings. Considering the challenger nodes need to run all nodes in Superchain with the interop future, leveraging OP Erigon is a huge win.\n\nSince Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following:\n- Support users to run & troubleshoot OP-Erigon.\n- Update the up-to-date upstream codes.\n- Port Erigon 3, which saves 90.9% of disk footprint compared to Geth on L1.\n- Host the archive node snapshots for OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, and Base Mainnet—350+ downloads per month.\n- Host the public RPC of OP Erigon & Otterscan, which serves 4.9k requests/day on average.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries from the notable users: \n\nRaz (CTO of Blockaid): With OP-Erigon, Blockaid could protect users in the Optimism ecosystem (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora) more effectively by leveraging its efficient disk space and performance. Moreover, working with Sunnyside Labs is a smooth experience—they help us troubleshoot, notify us of upcoming network upgrades, etc. We think their works are impactful, at least for us. \n\nEugene (CTO of Chainstack): Chainstack is using op-erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP Mainnet & Base. Thanks to op-erigon, we could run the archive nodes for the Optimism ecosystem more efficiently. Test in Prod was also helpful for the node operations by helping us troubleshoot, alerting us for upcoming upgrades, etc.\n\nChris (CEO of Blockjoy): Blockjoy provides dedicated unmetered op-erigon node services for customers needing high performance Erigon RPCs; notable customers are Trueblocks, Blockaid, etc. Operating nodes as efficiently as possible can require true expertise, this is why we enjoy working with Test in Prod & hope to continue working with them in the future!",

This guide covers a wide range of topics about Ethereum, transactions, smart contracts, data structures, wallets, block synchronization, state synchronization, miners, consensus, RPC, and P2P protocols.\n\nOver the past 6 years, I've made significant contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem, including the following:\n\n- go-ethereum: merged 119 PRs\n- reth: merged 79 PRs\n- prysm: merged 11 PRs\n- erigon: merged 9 PRs\n- others: merged 21 Prs\n",

We are developing mechanisms to ensure the L1 protocol maintains chain neutrality by empowering Ethereum’s decentralized set of validators to enforce the inclusion of transactions in Ethereum blocks through inclusion lists (ILs). Over the past year, we have explored the design space and made significant progress towards a proposal called Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), which we believe could be considered for inclusion in a future Ethereum upgrade. We have also collaborated with the Commit-Boost effort to develop out-of-protocol inclusion lists bridging the gap until a protocol solution is available.\n\nTiming games. Nearly a year ago, we named and introduced the concept of timing games in a publication, describing how proposers have an incentive to wait until the last moment to propose their blocks in order to maximize MEV rewards. Since then, we have observed timing games occurring in practice and have been working on mitigation strategies to maintain consensus stability. Timing games were central to critical discussions by the Ethereum research and builder communities over the last year.\n\nPBS. Our group has been at the forefront of PBS research for more than two years now. During the time period considered for this retroactive funding, we have deepened our understanding of the practice of PBS with research supporting EIP-7732 (“Enshrined Proposer–Builder Separation”). We have also been active in exploring MEV burn mechanisms, as well as the newer idea of “Attester–Proposer Separation”, with posts and publications.\n\nStaking economics. This group put forward the idea of rainbow staking dealing with an ever-changing staking landscape. It intends to embrace the heterogeneity of Ethereum's staking set and foresees different roles for different types of participants.

    "displayName": "1-Click Price Oracle",
    "description": "Traditionally, price oracles are deployed on a per network basic (on each rollup individually). This manual deployment process can be lengthy, expensive, and may require legal agreements to be signed. Furthermore, prices are pushed to each rollup in a siloed manner, repeatedly incurring all associated overhead. Overall, there is a lot of duplicate computation taking place despite the underlying price data being identical. The traditional oracle architecture is unscalable in a world of 1000s of Rollups.\n\nGelato's 1-Click Price Oracles are natively integrated into rollups. These native oracles are immediately available without any manual deployment process and hyper scalable by leveraging a unique property of the rollup architecture. Prices are published to- and verified by a single rollup (Hub) and disseminated to all other rollups (Spokes) whilst avoiding duplicate computation and all associated overhead.\n\nThe key insight making this possible is that rollups essentially act as indexers over the L1 allowing us to consume data such as emitted events in a process known as derivation. The derivation layer is a crucial component as it facilitates, among other things, deposits which are initiated on the L1 and executed on the L2. This is what allows users on the L1 to securely deposit tokens to the L2.\n\nHere is how a deposit works under the hood:\n\n- The user invokes a smart contract which locks up tokens on the L1 and emits a deposited event.\n- Whenever the rollup enters a new epoch (new L1 block), it iterates through transaction receipts in that block and fetches all deposited event logs.\n- For all deposited event logs, the rollup constructs corresponding deposit transactions which are included at the top of the next L2 block.\n\nGelato 1-Click Price Oracles fork and slightly modify the OP Stack to introduce an additional source to the derivation layer. We first deploy an L1PriceOracle smart contract which receives price updates from Pyth every two seconds via a Gelato Web3 Function. This smart contract is deployed once and shared between all rollups. It verifies the associated signature to ensure the price update is legitimate and emits a PricesUpdated event containing all updated price feeds. When the rollup enters a new epoch, in addition to iterating through all deposited event logs as before, it also iterates through all PricesUpdated event logs. Just like with deposits, the rollup then constructs a special top-of-block transaction which updates prices on the L2. This top-of-block transaction calls an L2PriceOracle predeploy smart contract which stores prices on-chain and exposes them via a Pyth-like interface.\n\nIn summary, prices are pushed to and verified by a single smart contract living on the L1. On every epoch, rollups essentially copy fresh prices from L1 to L2 during derivation. Since publishing & verification is done in a single place rather than by each rollup individually, we reduce the complexity of publishing & verification from O(n) to O(1). However, despite avoiding duplicate computation, publishing prices to an L1 such as Ethereum every two seconds is prohibitively expensive. Instead, prices are published to a cheaper L2, in our case Base, and consumed by 1-Click (Base) L3 rollups. Unlike traditional oracles, 1-Click Oracles actually perform better at scale since the costs of publishing & verifying the data is amortized between all rollups. In essence, the constant cost is divided between many rollups (1/N). In addition, whenever a price feed is introduced on the Hub (Base), it is instantly available on all 1-Click rollups without any additional work. This allows us to rapidly introduce new price feeds.

Optimism's EVM-equivalent architecture, makes the ecosystem more accessible to builders\n- ongoing maintainence of code-bases, support for network upgrades to make Ethereum more censorship resistant, secure, and accessible\n---------------------------------------\n\n--> A commons funding mechanism\n\nNo single individual/project could reproduce this software on their own. In recognition of this, the design of Protocol Guild is also grounded within the commons frame:\n\n1. Four year onchain vest, to individuals\n\nCommons stewardship plays out over time. Any funding drips slowly via immutable contracts to create legible guarantees for members + funders. Each member's share is time-weighted by their start date - which recognizes the local knowledge they've accumulated.\n\n2. Broad membership, regularly updated\n\nMembers come from +25 projects/teams across the entire Layer 1 contributor set. This wide-ranging curation ensures that less well known but equally impactful contributions are surfaced.\nThis membership is regularly updated onchain every quarter. When paired with the vest, this ensures funding goes to contributors that stick around long-term, or those that show up in the future - not just those that are around today.\n\nThrough these features, Protocol Guild is able to support long-term, transparent, & comprehensive Layer 1 stewardship.\n\n---------------------------\n--> \"Project\", not \"Org\"\n\nWithin the Retro Program context, Protocol Guild opts to represent itself as a \"Project\" instead of as an \"Organization.\"\n\n1. Fund the entire commons\n\nProtocol Guild aims to holistically fund the individuals engaged in Ethereum's core protocol , and not \"features\" or discrete projects of the protocol which will then compete against each other in the funding round.\n\n2. Funding, not project oversight\n\nProtocol Guild is scope-limited to allocate funding. The day-to-day activities of Ethereum projects/teams are not directed through Protocol Guild as an entity, or by any members in their affiliation as beneficiaries. Governance deliberations and roadmap decisions remain the responsibility of the broader community reaching rough consensus in public fora.\n\n3.

    "description": "The OP City Stack is a comprehensive research initiative focused on exploring the operation of the OP Stack and testing the capabilities of the Canon Fault Proofs Virtual Machine (Canon Fault Proofs VM). Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.",

It identifies the disputed point at the block level using multiple segments instead of bisection, requiring far fewer transactions. Moreover, it doesn’t necessitate storing large amounts of preimage oracle data on-chain, as verification can be achieved through ZK proofs.

By using zkVM instead of zkEVM, no additional maintenance efforts are required for the ZK circuit. The new proving scheme ensures that transaction execution is based on the batch data posted by the sequencer.
