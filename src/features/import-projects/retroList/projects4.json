    "description": "Shutter is a threshold encryption protocol with a wide variety of applications, including: malicious MEV prevention, censorship resistance, voting integrity, and gaming fairness. \n\n\nMost relevant for the OP Stack ecosystem is that we have built and deployed a dedicated OP Stack L2 testnet Shutterized Optimism (SHOP) with an in-protocol threshold encrypted mempool and are looking into generalizing this solution to more advanced cryptography primitives as well as deploying it across OP Stack networks. \n\n\nThe Shutterized Optimism testnet L2 launch on Sepolia marks the availability of a Shutterized encrypted mempool for the OP Stack, aiming to prevent front-running and provide a censorship-resistant trading environment. Shutterized OP Stack L2s bring a host of benefits, including: \n\n\n- Enhanced trading safety and profitability by mitigating front-running. \n- Added (real-time) censorship resistance. \n- Reduced trust assumptions in sequencers through transaction encryption. \n- Potential compliance and regulatory benefits by limiting the sequencer's ability to manipulate transactions.\n\nAdditionally, we have created the SHOP SDK (Shutterized Optimism SDK), a custom ethersjs provider, that allows to send shutter encrypted (\"shutterized\") transactions on Shutter-Optimism. The goal of the SHOP SDK is to make it as easy as possible to transform a traditional application that could run on Optimism into an MEV-protected version running on Shutter-Optimism.",
